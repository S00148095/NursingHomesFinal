        <h1>Listings</h1>
        <article class="columns">
            <!-- This has to go to a different page, and probably be shortened significantly --
            <p>Listing on our site is free, with the option of additional features which can be added to your listing. For free,
                we give you the most comprehensive listing of your services.</p><p>From the listing on our site a potential patient
                or family member can contact you directly from the listings page via our contact box, which has a number of pre-selected
                topics for the enquiry.  This enquiry will be instantly sent directly into your E-mail inbox, and also into your
                EMS (Enquiry Management System), if you choose the EMS as part of your listing package. This gives you insights
                on how your listing is preforming, and you now know where the enquiry has originated from.</p><p>We allow users of our
                site to leave reviews on a Nursing Home listing for the benefits of other potential users to make better, informed
                decisions on choosing care for their loved ones. Once a review has been made on your listing you will be notified
                of the review being made, where you can, from a number of pre-set responses, select your response to that review.
                On our paid listing packages there are a greater number of pre-selected responses to choose from.</p><p>Once a review
                had been made and a response selected, other users of the site with be able to agree or disagree with the review
                and the response. The reviewer will be able to ‘Score’ your homes listing on a number of factors such as staff,
                management, facilities and cleanliness etc.</p><p>Some of the factors taken into account in showing your listing at
                the top of the listings page are the ‘Overall Score’ from the user reviews, and the number of reviews.</p><p>Our aim
                is to drive the quality and standards of the nursing home industry upwards through our user’s reviews and feedback.
                The better your listing and the greater number of good reviews the higher you’re listing will be displayed
                on our search pages.</p><p>We have taken all the possible measures to avoid misuse of the review system.  One of those
                steps is that a user must be logged in with a valid e-mail address in order to leave a review, and their name
                will be partially visible alongside their review.</p><p>Any reported claims of misuse will be followed up by our review
                team, and the necessary action taken. We may already have you listed, (basic free listing) to find out if
                you're listed, click on claim listing and search for your nursing home.  If your listed you’ll see a claim listing
                button, click to edit, update or upgrade your listing.

        <h1>Enquiry Management System</h1>
        <!-- this has to go to a different page --
        <p>Careze has developed a simple system to enable Nursing Homes to interact and respond to enquiries made by potential
            users of your service, in a timely and efficient manner. It allows you to manage the process of the various stages
            form an initial enquiry all the way through to patient admission. Our Enquiry Management System (EMS) gives you
            a user dashboard to handle all new enquiries that are generated form users viewing the listing profile of your
            nursing home on our listings page. The details of the user’s enquiry will automatically filter into the EMS where
            you will be able to send automatic responses to that user. These responses can be brochures which gives the user
            further information on your services, a detailed list of suitable viewing times, or a request to full out further
            patient information. When the enquiry is first worked by a member of staff, they can then move this enquiry to
            the next stage of the process, such as collecting patient information, scheduling viewings, awaiting funding
            approval, right the way through to patient admission. There are currently two versions of the EMS available a
            standard package with pre-set stages of the enquiry to admission process, and an advance customisable package,
            which allows you to edit and add stages to the process.
