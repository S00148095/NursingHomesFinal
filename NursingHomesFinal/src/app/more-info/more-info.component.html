      <p>Listing on our site is free, with the option of additional features which can be added to your listing. For free, we
        give you the most comprehensive listing of your services.</p>
      <p>From the listing on our site a potential patient or family member can contact you directly from the listings page via
        our contact box, which has a number of pre-selected topics for the enquiry. This enquiry will be instantly sent directly
        into your E-mail inbox, and also into your EMS (Enquiry Management System), if you choose the EMS as part of your
        listing package. This gives you insights on how your listing is preforming, and you now know where the enquiry has
        originated from.
      </p>
      <p>We allow users of our site to leave reviews on a Nursing Home listing for the benefits of other potential users to
        make better, informed decisions on choosing care for their loved ones. Once a review has been made on your listing
        you will be notified of the review being made, where you can, from a number of pre-set responses, select your response
        to that review. On our paid listing packages there are a greater number of pre-selected responses to choose from.</p>
      <p>Once a review had been made and a response selected, other users of the site with be able to agree or disagree with
        the review and the response. The reviewer will be able to ‘Score’ your homes listing on a number of factors such
        as staff, management, facilities and cleanliness etc.</p>
      <p>Some of the factors taken into account in showing your listing at the top of the listings page are the ‘Overall Score’
        from the user reviews, and the number of reviews.</p>
      <p>Our aim is to drive the quality and standards of the nursing home industry upwards through our user’s reviews and feedback.
        The better your listing and the greater number of good reviews the higher you’re listing will be displayed on our
        search pages.
      </p>
      <p>We have taken all the possible measures to avoid misuse of the review system. One of those steps is that a user must
        be logged in with a valid e-mail address in order to leave a review, and their name will be partially visible alongside
        their review.</p>
      <p>Any reported claims of misuse will be followed up by our review team, and the necessary action taken. We may already
        have you listed, (basic free listing) to find out if you're listed, click on claim listing and search for your nursing
        home. If your listed you’ll see a claim listing button, click to edit, update or upgrade your listing.

    <h1>Enquiry Management System</h1>
    <p>Careze has developed a simple system to enable Nursing Homes to interact and respond to enquiries made by potential users
      of your service, in a timely and efficient manner. It allows you to manage the process of the various stages form an
      initial enquiry all the way through to patient admission. Our Enquiry Management System (EMS) gives you a user dashboard
      to handle all new enquiries that are generated form users viewing the listing profile of your nursing home on our listings
      page. The details of the user’s enquiry will automatically filter into the EMS where you will be able to send automatic
      responses to that user. These responses can be brochures which gives the user further information on your services,
      a detailed list of suitable viewing times, or a request to full out further patient information. When the enquiry is
      first worked by a member of staff, they can then move this enquiry to the next stage of the process, such as collecting
      patient information, scheduling viewings, awaiting funding approval, right the way through to patient admission. There
      are currently two versions of the EMS available a standard package with pre-set stages of the enquiry to admission
      process, and an advance customisable package, which allows you to edit and add stages to the process.
